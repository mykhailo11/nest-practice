# Practice

Tried to implement some server using Node JS (first time in my life). Not finished yet, but at least I learned how to use modules, decorators and ORMs (both prisma and typeorm). Very similar to Spring, not sure if there are any benefits of using Nest framework instead of latest Spring Boot versions.
